**1. Marketing Play | Wealth Marketing Platform**

- ***Background***
  
In recent years, Yu'ebao's returns have declined, reducing the effectiveness of organic traffic in driving business growth. In the era of stock competition, large-scale marketing promotions with traffic aggregation effects have become the most effective means to drive Yu'ebao's business growth, making such promotions more frequent. However, marketing promotions are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and high-risk projects, which conflicts with the requirement for rapid business launch and iteration. Hence, there was a need for a system that integrates marketing elements and uses systematic methods to address risk identification and handling.

- ***Task***
  
Design the wealth marketing platform from scratch and build real-time risk control capabilities.

- ***Specific Steps***
  
1. Abstract marketing models, manage the lifecycle and data flow of marketing domain entities, and unify front-end and back-end data interaction protocols.
2. Develop a marketing play execution engine using a pipeline pattern to support the串联 of atomic marketing capabilities.
3. Build an underlying virtual asset system for marketing, providing basic capabilities for high-concurrency virtual asset抢兑 and queries.
4. Build real-time risk identification and interception capabilities around the play engine.
   
- ***Result***

Since its launch in early 2024, the marketing platform has not only effectively supported Ant Wealth's major promotions (e.g., "Year After Year Abundance," Yu'ebao Anniversary, 818 Wealth Day, 218 Wealth Day - S-level promotions with over 100 million users) but also daily marketing scenarios. Development efficiency improved by 50%, while the timeliness of risk identification and handling increased by 60%.
  
**2. Marketing Productization & Intelligence | Wealth Marketing Platform**

- ***Background***

In the initial 0 to 1 phase, the marketing platform achieved scaled capability building, handling over 80% of the wealth team's marketing business requirements. However, as more business units joined, configuration bugs, configuration inquiries, and configuration risk checks became the team's biggest消耗. There was an urgent need to further abstract the marketing platform model and present its capabilities using more productized concepts to reduce configuration understanding costs and error rates. Additionally, to refocus development resources on system development and optimization, there was a need to explore multi-agent-based marketing collaboration capabilities around productized features, reducing reliance on developers for wealth marketing.

- ***Task***
1. Further abstract the marketing platform model and present marketing capabilities externally using productized concepts.
2. Explore Multi-Agent to build marketing collaboration capabilities and free up development resources.
                                    
- ***Specific Steps***
1. Standardized activity, play, supply, and strategy models, achieving **zero-code marketing activity configuration**, reducing configuration costs by 70% and configuration bugs by 36%.
2. Developed marketing multi-agents, building AI-based marketing intelligent assistance capabilities, and established a collaboration evaluation mechanism with an accuracy rate of over 70%.
   
- ***Result***

The marketing platform productization initiative started in early 2025. After its launch in May 2025, it efficiently supported the Yu'ebao 12th Anniversary promotion (100M+ user visits). During development, configuration costs decreased by 70%, and bugs reduced by 36%. Furthermore, the LLM-based marketing intelligent assistance capability effectively reduced platform usage costs, freed up 40% of答疑 resources, and identified a viable path for AI implementation in marketing scenarios.

**3. Financial Settlement | Logistics Settlement Productization** 

- ***Background***
  
STO Express's financial settlement system used TD's traditional industry solution, where all financial settlement logic was implemented using SQL scripts, involving 1000+ Oracle scheduling tasks, 100+ financial reports, and 200+ stored procedures. The TD system was封闭, difficult to scale, and had high maintenance and operational costs. The core challenges were improving development iteration efficiency, building cloud-based settlement, and achieving a smooth transition between the old and new systems.

- ***Task***
1. Build financial settlement productization capabilities to manage billing subjects and billing metadata. Ensure billing subject scripts are easy to modify, test, and verify; the billing system is monitorable; and the calculation process is traceable.
2. Achieve a smooth transition between the old and new systems.
                                    
- ***Specific Steps***
1. Maintained a business perspective, organizing strategy, rule, and factor (rates, features) domain models around billing subjects.
2. Developed a financial settlement billing engine to consume upstream settlement messages in real-time, enabling real-time waybill cost calculation.
3. Achieved a smooth system transition by developing a grayscale release plan: first, switching the settlement process flow, then switching the TD data source flow, and finally switching the reporting layer flow.

- ***Result***
1. The subject-centered financial settlement productization, compared to TD, achieved settlement business transparency and accelerated business iteration speed.
2. Financial settlement was successfully migrated to the cloud, eliminating expensive TD outsourcing and reducing software costs from 5M RMB to 2.5M RMB.
